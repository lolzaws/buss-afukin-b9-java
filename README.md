# What this project is about...
It's a custom browser for Bussin Web X of [face-hh](https://github.com/face-hh).
It uses JavaFX for the interface and Java because it can run on any machine regardless of dependencies.

# A few more notes
I will also add a javascript interpreter, just to start. Because Lua lacks a ton of functionality that only javascript has.
I know it is not supposed to have javascript but Lua is not really great for the deed.

# Key desing
- Bussin was designed to only support Lua for browser scripting, but it doesn't really fixes javascript problems.
I will add a JS interpreter as well a Lua interpreter. So both sites scripted in Lua and JS can work fine and even interop if so.

- Java may fix the incompatibility by shipping standalone jar files that run on JRE.

Overall it focus on compatibility and adds functionality.
